Road to Web Developer - Episode 5 - Searching a good app to practice english speech

I been searching in this days, a decent app to practice my speech with foreign people, 
with the english how is native language or not, don't matter, I try a couple of apps this
days, the first was Tandem is very popular but has a premium version with more characteristics
for looking for a person to practice, I only have the free version. The second "app" is the
Refold Discord server, but in this days is look a little empty or maybe I dont have access to
the section to look for a partner for practice, I recently resume my lecture of the roadmap in 
is website.

My journey in Toptal, and similar programs

I will start tomorrow applying for this programs and improving my english for afront all the challenges
I need to confront, but first I need to make a resume and search what is the difference between a resume
and a curriculum, of course if I dont do this I can't start applying for jobs, the rest I need made 
my personal portfolio and perfectionate my linkedin profile, complete FCC backend course and TDD course
to get my certificates.

The first thing I want to do is improving my english, if I dont do this I can't pretend to get a job in a
work sector where is fundamental, other thing to discuss is when is sufficient to considerate I'm ready
for get a job
